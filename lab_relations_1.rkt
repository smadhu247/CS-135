;; In this lab, you will write various functions which operate over relations.
;; We'll represent a relation as a set of pairs of numbers.
;; (NOTE: references to "pairs" in this lab refer to ordered lists of two numbers,
;;        not the Scheme data structure of pairs.)
;; A set containing the pair (x y) means an edge points from x to y in the relation.
;;
;; Every relation in this lab will have a subset of the positive integers as its domain,
;;   which will be written as [1, n]. Such a domain is the integers 1, 2, ..., n.
;;
;; Again, like in last lab, we'll use lists to represent sets,
;;   but we won't let there be duplicate elements
;;   and we won't care about the element order.
;; If a function you write outputs a relation
;;   and your output doesn't have the same order as the examples, that's okay.
;;
;; This lab will build off of the previous lab.
;; At the bottom of this file, you'll find many helper functions,
;;   all from the previous lab, to help you complete this one.




;; Implement "id" to accept an integer (which you may assume is positive)
;;   and return the "identity relation" from 1 to n.
;; This means it should create a set
;;   containing the pairs (1 1), (2 2), ..., (n n).
;;
;; Examples:
;; (id 1) -> '((1 1))
;; (id 5) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (4 4) (5 5))
;;
;; Type Signature: (id int) -> relation
(define (id n)
 ( cond ((equal? n 0)'())
        (append (cons (list n n) (id (- n 1))))) ) 




;; Implement "reflexive?" to accept a relation R and a positive integer n,
;;   and return whether R is reflexive over the domain [1, n].
;; In other words, R is reflexive iff it contains the the id relation up to n.
;; This can be implemented easily using id and one of the provided helper functions.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (reflexive? '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3)) 3) -> #t
;; (reflexive? '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (3 2) (2 3)) 3) -> #t
;; (reflexive? '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3)) 4) -> #f
;;
;; Type Signature: (reflexive? relation int) -> boolean
(define (reflexive? R n)
  (cond ((subset? (id n) R) #t)
        (else #f)) )




;; Implement "reflexive-closure" to accept a relation R and a positive integer n,
;;   and return the reflexive closure of R with respect to the domain [1, n].
;; The reflexive closure of R is the smallest relation which
;;   contains R and is reflextive over [1, n].
;;
;; Examples:
;; (reflexive-closure '() 3) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3))
;; (reflexive-closure '((3 2) (2 3)) 3) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (3 2) (2 3))
;; (reflexive-closure '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3)) 4) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (4 4))
;;
;; Type Signature: (reflexive-closure relation int) -> relation
(define (reflexive-closure R n)
 (cond ((equal? n 0) '())
       (else (make-set(append (id n) R)))
  ))




;; Implement "inverse", which accepts a relation R
;;   and returns the inverse relation of R.
;; In other words, inverse changes every edge (x y) in R into (y x).
;; Scheme's "reverse" and "map" functions may be useful here.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (inverse '((1 2) (3 2) (4 5))) -> '((2 1) (2 3) (5 4))
;; (inverse '((1 1) (1 2) (1 3))) -> '((1 1) (2 1) (3 1))
;;
;; Type Signature: (inverse relation) -> relation
(define (inverse R)
  (cond ((equal? R '()) '())
        (else (cons (reverse (car R)) (inverse (cdr R))) )
   ))




;; Implement "symmetric?", which accepts a relation R
;;   and returns whether R is symmetric.
;; R is symmetric iff for every pair (x y) in R,
;;   R also contains the pair (y x).
;; This can be implemented easily using inverse
;;   and one of the provided helper functions.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (symmetric? '((1 1) (2 1) (1 2))) -> #t
;; (symmetric? '((1 1) (2 4) (3 7) (3 5) (5 3))) -> #f
;; (symmetric? '((2 4) (4 3) (3 4) (4 2))) -> #t
;;
;; Type Signature: (reflexive? relation int) -> boolean
(define (symmetric? R)
  (cond ((subset? (inverse R) R) #t)
    (else #f)) )




;; Implement "symmetric-closure" to return the symmetric closure
;;   of a given relation R.
;; The symmetric closure of R is the smallest relation
;;   which is symmetric and contains R.
;; In other words, if R contains an edge (x y) but not the edge (y x),
;;   the symmetric closure ought to contain both (x y) and (y x).
;; This can be implemented easily using inverse
;;   and one of the provided helper functions.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (symmetric-closure '()) -> '()
;; (symmetric-closure '((3 2) (2 3))) -> '((3 2) (2 3))
;; (symmetric-closure '((1 2) (2 7) (3 4))) -> '((1 2) (2 7) (3 4) (2 1) (7 2) (4 3))
;;
;; Type Signature: (reflexive-closure relation) -> relation
(define (symmetric-closure R)
  (cond ((equal? R '()) '())
        (else(make-set(append R (inverse R))))
    ))




;; Implement "relates-to", which accepts a relation R and a vertex v
;;   and returns the set of vertices to which v relates through R.
;; v relates to a vertex y through R iff the pair (v y) is in R.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (relates-to 3 '((3 3) (3 4) (3 5))) -> '(3 4 5)
;; (relates-to 1 '((1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4 5))) -> '(2)
;; (relates-to 2 '((1 3) (3 5) (4 6) (8 7))) -> '()
;;
;; Type Signature: (relates-to vertex relation) -> set
(define (relates-to v R)
  (cond ((equal? R '()) '())
        ((equal? (car(car R)) v) (append (append (cdr(car R)) '()) (relates-to v (cdr R))) )
        (else (relates-to v (cdr R)))
   ))
