;; This lab is an introduction to using lists in Scheme.
;; All lists in Scheme are linked lists,
;;   meaning lists are either null (empty),
;;   or a pair of a head (the first element)
;;   and tail (the rest of the list).
;; That means you can only directly access the first element of a list!
;; To access subsequent elements you have to repeatedly access tails.
;;
;; Scheme has the tick operator ' also called "quote".
;; The tick operator is used to tell the interpreter to treat a symbol
;; as a literal rather than evaluating it as an expression.
;; When you quote a list, it quotes each sub-expression in the list,
;;   allowing you to create nested lists with just one tick mark.


;; Building Lists

'()  ;; <- This is the empty list

;; To build a list of multiple values, use the "list" function.
;; The code below will return the list (1 2 3).
(list 1 2 3)

;; The code below will return the list (a b).
(list 'a 'b)
;; By putting ticks before a and b, they are treated as literals
;;   rather than as variables.
;; Note: '(a b c d) is the same as (list 'a 'b 'c 'd).

;; To check if a list is empty, use the "null?" function.
;; Type signature: (null? list) -> boolean

;; To check how many elements are in a list, use "length".
;; Type signature: (length list) -> integer 

;; To reverse the order of elements in a list, use "reverse".
;; Type signature: (reverse list) -> list

;; To add one element to the beginning of a list, use "cons".
;; Type signature: (cons element list) -> list

;; To combine two lists, use "append".
;; Type signature: (append list list) -> list

;; To get the first element of a list, use "car".
;; Type signature: (car list) -> element

;; To get the tail of a list (everything except the first element), use "cdr".
;; Type signature (cdr list) -> list

;; NOTE: car and cdr throw exceptions when handed empty lists.





;; Implement the function "name" which accepts a first and last name,
;;   and returns a list with the first and last name.
;; Example: (name "Sandeep" "Bhatt") -> ("Sandeep" "Bhatt")

;; Type signature: (name string string) -> string-list
(define (name first last)
  (list first last))




;; Implement "last-name" which takes a list containing
;; '(first-name last-name) and returns last-name.

;; Type signature: (last-name '(string string)) -> string
(define (last-name name)
  (car(cdr name)))



;; In Scheme you can have lists of lists, a.k.a. "nested lists".
;; We'll represent a "student" with a nested list of the following structure:

(define example-student
  '((IDnumber Degree)
    (LastName FirstName)
    (day month year)
    (class-year ((major) (minor)) GPA)
    ((number street apt) (city state zip))
    (class1 class2 ... classN)))


;; Here are two example students to test your functions with:

(define stu1
  '((12345 "Bachelor of Science")
    ("Dongle" "Jonathy")
    (29 "February" 1999)
    (2021 (("Computer Science") ("Math")) 3.75)
    ((5 "Bubble Street" 16) ("Hoboken" "NJ" "07030"))
    ("CS-334" "CS-385" "MA-331" "BT-353")))

(define stu2
  '((10101010101 "Bachelor of Science")
    ("Sprimpling" "Sir Ardlinton")
    (1 "December" 1852)
    (1874 (("Engineering") ("Literature")) 4.000001)
    ((999 "Road Street" 11) ("Old Town Place" "MA" "00001"))
    ("MA-121" "CAL-103" "PE-200" "CH-115" "E-101")))

;; Based on the student template, complete the following definitions
;;   using nested car and cdr calls.

;; Example:
(define (birthday student)
  (car (cdr (cdr student))))
;; Since the birthday is the third element in the student list, we can access it
;;   by dropping the first two elements (by using cdr twice),
;;   then using car to get the first remaining element.
;; To test these functions you can call, for example, (birthday stu1) and that should return (29 "February" 1999).

;; NOTE: Racket has extra functions for shorthands of nested car's and cdr's,
;;    so the birthday function body could also be written as (caddr student).
;; A shorthand function exists for every permutation of up to 4 car's and cdr's. Here they all are:
;;    https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#%28part._.Pair_.Accessor_.Shorthands%29



;; Now implement the following functions:

;; Returns the 'IDnumber field
(define (IDnumber student)
  (car (car student)))

;; Returns '((number street apt) (city state zip))
(define (address student)
  (car(cdr(cdr(cdr(cdr student))))))

;; Returns the 'GPA field
(define (GPA student)
  (car(reverse (car(cdr(cdr(cdr student)))))))

;; Returns the 'state field
(define (state student)
  (car(cdr(car(cdr(car(cdr(cdr(cdr(cdr student))))))))))




;; Implement the function "pig-latin".
;; It follows the rules of Pig Latin, so
;; (pig-latin '(h a p p y)) => '(a p p y h a y)
;; (pig-latin '(b i r t h d a y)) => '(i r t h d a y b a y)

;; Assume that you only need to remove the first letter of the word,
;;   and that the word will not be empty.

;; You can use this variable "ay" instead of '(a y) in your definition
(define ay '(a y))

(define (pig-latin word)
  (append (cdr word) (cons (car word) '(a y))))




;; Implement the function "yoda" that takes a list of three words
;;   and returns it in Yoda-speak (i.e. (w1 w2 w3) becomes (w3 w1 w2))
;;   using the functions you learned above.

;; Examples:
;; (yoda '(I am Groot)) => '(Groot I am)
;; (yoda '(I love racket)) => '(racket I love)
;; (yoda '(Sandeep is shiny-headed)) => '(shiny-headed Sandeep is)

(define (yoda 3-words)
  (cons  (car(cdr(cdr 3-words)))  (cons (car 3-words)  (list (car (cdr 3-words)))  )))

; Groot: (list car(cdr(cdr 3-words)))
; am : (car (cdr 3-words) 
;;(cons (car 3-words) (list (car(cdr(3-words)))))
